# jq-course.local

This project was made by me when I was learning jQuery and jQuery UI.
It consist of the following main elements:

+ Search autocomplete (jQuery UI Autocomplete)
+ Navigation menu (jQuery UI Accordion )
+ Login dialog box with full validation (jQuery UI Dialog)
+ Slider-pagination (my custom jQuery plugin for pagination)
+ Quote service (random quotes from another domain with use of JSONP)

This project is private and should not be used by anyone in their own projects.
